# Doubly Linked List

**Doubly linked list** is a type of linked list in witch each node apart from storing its data has two links. The first link points to the previous node in the list and second link points to the next node in the list. The first node of the list has it precious link pointing tu `nil` similarity the last node of the list has its next link pointing to `nil`. 

The two links help us to traverse the list in both directions. But storing an extra link requires some extra space.
