# QUEUE

**A Queue** is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is *First In First Out (FIFO)*. A difference between **stacks** and **queues** is in removing, in a stack the last added item will be removed first, but in queue the first added element will be first removed.
