# Binary Tree

**Binary tree** is a tree data structure where each node can have no more than two "children" node and max one "parent" node. The node without parent is called a **root** node, and nodes without children nodes are called **leaves**.

A binary tree in which each node has exactly zero or two children is called **a full binary tree**. In a full tree, there are no nodes with exactly one child.

**A complete binary tree** is a tree, which is completely filled, with the possible exception of the bottom level, which is filled from left to right.
